# Rust Tutorial
These are the Rust scripts i wrote while I was learning the language.
!!! As this is a tutorial I'm updating as I go, some things in the documentation will not be complete !!!

I have learned Rust using various resources. I'm listing the major ones below:
1. [Official Rust Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
2. [Tutorialspoint ... tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/rust/index.htm)

In the [[Lessons]] directory, I have put all the code files I've written as I'm learning Rust.
In the [[Algorithms]] directory I want to try and write some classic problem solving algorithms (e.g. knapsack problem, dynamic programming, mathematical prolems, e.t.c.) for practice.

Down the road I want to add a section for Image processing, and even futher down I want to attempt to make Neural Networks and Machine Learning algorithms! I doubt it, but putting it here might apply enough pressure on me to actually do it.
