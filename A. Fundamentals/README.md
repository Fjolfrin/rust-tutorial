# Fundamentals

This folder contains scripts that address the fundamental notions of the Rust programming language. These are the first Rust scripts I've ever written, and helped me understand the basic syntax, commands, and code structure involved in this language.

## Contents
1. **hello_world:** A simple "Hello World!" program.
2. **guessing_game:** A simple "game" where the user tries to guess a secret number between 0 and 100.
3. **variables:** Experimentation with variable types in Rust.
4. **functions:** Experimentation with function declaration and structure in Rust.
5. **control_flow:** Experimentation with control flow (if statements, repetition loops) in Rust.
